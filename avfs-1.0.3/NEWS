Changes from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 (2015-06-13)
   - fixed zlib assert triggered for some Huffman encodings
   - added rar v5 in extfs urar (which is also renamed to uextrar to avoid
     collision with internal rar module)
   - some configure script improvements have been done for fuse and liblzma
     dependencies

Changes from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 (2014-06-29)

     archive, state, and utar
   - added support in utar modules for files larger than 8GB
   - added zip64 support in uzip module to support more than 64k files
     and files larger then 4 GiB

     will no longer be pseudo PaxHeaders files)
   - changed some extfs scripts to no longer require bash

Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 (2012-06-12)
   - compile fixes for macos

     Access is slower for some operations (e.g. seeking)
   - updated bzlib to 1.0.6
   - support for liblzma has been added so xz and lzma files
     can be accessed. There is also a module named uxze which

     - extfs scripts rpm and trpm outputs correct file sizes (important for fuse)
       (patch from Tanmoy Bhattacharya)
   - ftppass/davpass checks for additional base avfs directories. Environment
     variable AVFSBASE can be set for non-default directory.
     (patch from Tanmoy Bhattacharya)

     (patch from Tanmoy Bhattacharya)
   - the avfs library is built and installed by default additionally to
     fuse/avfscoda/preload depending on the actual system

     (patch from Tanmoy Bhattacharya)

Changes from 0.9.6 to 0.9.7 (2006-06-14)
   - Fuse daemon can now be installed with --enable-fuse
   - added symlink rewriting code to make absolute symlinks relative
     There is an avfsstat entry to toggle this symlink rewrite
   - temporary files from extfs are cached which speeds up accessing files
     inside extfs archives
   - urar module uses unrar in case of missing rar

     support ftp servers which don't allow the "-an" argument

   - fixed return value of local_close so errors in close() can be detected
   - updated date parsing in extfs so patchfs handler works again
   - urar module should be able to read rar archives from newer rar versions

Changes from 0.9.3 to 0.9.5
   - improved support for magic character inside filenames
   - fixed endless loop in bz2 handler
   - automake is now used for building avfs
   - updated extfs handlers
   - other small bugfixes (see ChangeLog for details)

Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.9.3
   - Bugfixes (see ChangeLog for details)

Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1
  - Lots of bugfixes (see ChangeLog for details)
  - Optimized lookups in large directories

Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.9.0
  - Major rewrite touching almost all interfaces and code
  - Magic char changed from '@' to '#'. I hope this is the last such
    change ;)
  - New handlers:
      o ftp (read only for the moment)
      o http
      o rsh
      o dav (contributed by Justin Mason)
  - Other improvements:
      o Indexing of gzip and bzip2 files. This achieves fast random
        access to the uncompressed files without caching to whole file.
      o Better disk cache management, tunable parameters in
        /#avfsstat/cache
      o Multi-threaded operation for avfscoda and preload
      o Philosophy change for preload method: only a thin client is
        preloaded, work done in a server
      o Write support is working in avfscoda, redir doesn't fully
        support this yet
      o Support for avfscoda with reiserfs (2.4.4 and above)
   - Degradations:
      o ugz, utar, floppy, are now read only. Will be fixed.
      o Preload is only supported on Solaris, old Linux libc's are now
        not supported.
      o A few things are missing from the preload method (you can't
        'cd' into archive, mmap() doesn't work, etc.), Will eventually
        be fixed.

 - Tested on Solaris 2.7
 - Changed module versioning scheme
